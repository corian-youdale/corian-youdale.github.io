        <h2>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <h4><em>What is it and what are the benefits?</em></h4>
        <br>
        <p>Neuroplasticity  is the process by which all permanent learning takes place in your brain and makes your brain extremely resilient.
            There are many ways in which Neuroplasticity and having an understanding of the basic principles of it can benefit people.
            <br><br>
            Neuroplasticity enables people to recover from stroke, injury, and helps create new ways of functioning and behaviour for those experiencing autism, ADD, learning disabilities, depression and addictions, and obsessive-compulsive patterns.
            <br>
            Although brain injury is a difficult thing to recover from, it is paradoxically one of the best times to take advantage of the brain’s neuroplastic abilities as this is when the brain is most capable of making significant changes, reorganizing and recovering.
            <br> Other benefits can include (but are not limited to):
            <ul>
                <li>Enhanced memory abilities</li>
                <li>Wide range of enhanced cognitive abilities</li>
                <li>More effective learning</li>
                <li>Helping people treat chronic pain, anxiety or depression, ADHD, OCD and Autism</li>>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4><em>How can you increase your own Neuroplasticity?</em></h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity is the selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains, also known as brain plasticity or brain malleability.
                To put it simply, neuroplasticity refers to our brains ability to adapt.
                <br> By exposing the brain to novel stimuli and new environments through travel we can open up new pathways and activity in the brain.
                <br> Other examples of forcing our brain to adapt include doing exercises with our non-dominant hand to form new neural pathways and strengthen the connectivity between neurons.
            </p>
            <h4><em>How can we utilise Neuroplasticity for our own benefit?</em></h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                “One could speculate that this process opens up the possibility to reinvent yourself and move away from the status quo or to overcome past traumatic events that evoke anxiety and stress.
                Hardwired fear-based memories often lead to avoidance behaviours that can hold you back from living your life to the fullest” <em>- Christopher Bergland (2007)</em>
                <br><br>
                When we learn, we form new pathways in the brain.
                Each new lesson has the potential to connect new neurons and change our brain's default mode of operation.
