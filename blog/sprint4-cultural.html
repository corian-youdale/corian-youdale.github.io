        <h2>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <h4><em>What is it and what are the benefits?</em></h4>
        <p>Neuroplasticity  is the process by which all permanent learning takes place in your brain and makes your brain extremely resilient.
            <br>There are many ways in which Neuroplasticity and having an understanding of the basic principles of it can benefit people.
            <br><br>
            Neuroplasticity enables people to recover from strokes and brain injuries.
            It also helps create new ways of functioning and behaviour for those experiencing autism, ADD, learning disabilities, depression and addictions, and obsessive-compulsive patterns.
            <br>
            Although brain injury is a difficult thing to recover from, it is paradoxically one of the best times to take advantage of the brain’s neuroplastic abilities as this is when the brain is most capable of making significant changes, reorganizing and recovering.
            <br> Other benefits can include (but are not limited to):
            <ul>
                <li>Enhanced memory abilities</li>
                <li>Wide range of enhanced cognitive abilities</li>
                <li>More effective learning</li>
                <li>Helping people treat chronic pain, anxiety or depression, ADHD, OCD and Autism</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4><em>How can you increase your own Neuroplasticity?</em></h4>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity is the selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains, also known as brain plasticity or brain malleability.
                To put it simply, neuroplasticity refers to our brains ability to adapt.
                By exposing the brain to enriched environments (saturated with novelty, focused attention, and challenge) we can open up new pathways and activity in the brain.
                <br> Another example of forcing our brain to adapt is doing exercises with our non-dominant hand to form new neural pathways and strengthen the connectivity between neurons.
                <br> Creating artwork or learning a musical instrument can enhance the connectivity of the brain at rest which can boost introspection, memory, empathy, attention and focus.
                <br><br>
                Adequate sleep may enhance neurogenesis while chronic insomnia is associated with atrophy (neuronal death and damage) in the hippocampus <em>(Joo et al., 2014)</em>.
                <br> In summary, in order to increase your own Neuroplasticity you must strive towards sustained effort and a healthy lifestyle.
                Physical activity and good physical fitness can prevent or slow the normal age-related neuronal death and damage to the hippocampus, and even increase the volume of the hippocampus <em>(Niemann et al., 2014)</em>.
            </p>
            <br>    
            <h4><em>How can we utilise Neuroplasticity for our own benefit?</em></h4>
            <p>
                “One could speculate that this process opens up the possibility to reinvent yourself and move away from the status quo or to overcome past traumatic events that evoke anxiety and stress.
                Hardwired fear-based memories often lead to avoidance behaviours that can hold you back from living your life to the fullest” <em>- Christopher Bergland (2007)</em>
                <br><br>
                Mindfulness Meditation can change the brain through neuroplasticity.
                By rewiring your brain to take a more pleasant outlook of your thoughts and emotions you are promoting this way of thought as the new default.
                The more your brain changes from meditation, the more you react to everyday life with the same sense of calm, compassion and awareness.
                <br><br>
                When we learn, we form new pathways in the brain.
                Each new lesson has the potential to connect new neurons and change our brain's default mode of operation.
                <br>The concepts of Growth Mindset and Neuroplasticity mirror each other - A Growth Mindset is a mindset that one’s innate skills, talents, and abilities can be developed and/or improved with determination, while Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt and develop beyond the usual developmental period of childhood.
                You could say (on a broad level) that a Growth Mindset is simply accepting the idea of Neuroplasticity.
                <br><br>
                To learn more about how we can utilise Neuroplasticity for our own benefit, lets look into the closely linked concept of <strong>Growth Mindset</strong>.

            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
                <h4><em>What is it and what are the benefits?</em></h4>
            <p>
                “In a <strong>Growth Mindset</strong> students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence.
                They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.” <em>- Carol Dweck</em>
                <br><br>
                “In a <strong>Fixed Minset</strong> students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits.
                They have a certain amount and that’s that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb.” <em>- Carol Dweck</em>
                <br><br>
                The main difference between the two mindsets is the belief in the permanence of intelligence and ability; one views it as very permanent, with little to no room for change in either direction, while the other views it as more changeable, with opportunities for improvement (or regression).
                <br>
                A Growth Mindset allows you to see that confidence, willpower, determination and perseverance are all qualities that can be <em>developed</em> through your actions, they are <strong>not</strong> inherent.
                <br>
                This will provide you with more perseverance when you encounter a difficult problem, giving you more confidence and ultimately leading to increased Neuroplasticity.
                <br><br>
                With a growth mindset, individuals may achieve more than others because they are worrying less about seeming smart or talented and putting more of their energy into learning <em>(Dweck, 2016)</em>.
            <br><br>
            </p>
            <h4><em>Integrating Growth Mindset into your Learning Journey</em></h4>
                <p>
                    While researching and studying Growth and Fixed Mindsets I was quick to discover that I came from a Fixed Mindset.
                    My early learning was performance orientated with praise and emphasis placed on performance and results rather than the effort displayed.
                    This didn't necessarily come as a surprise to me, but I did quickly develop a strong desire to develop a Growth Mindset (and identify and acknowledge my Fixed Mindset).
                    <br>
                    I was surprised to find out that things are not as black as white as either having a 'Fixed' or 'Growth' Mindset, but that you can have both mindsets - growth mindset in some areas, and a fixed mindset in others.
                    Just like with <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong>, the first step is acknowledging, and this simple step can open you up to a world of growth and development.
                    <br><br>
                    So I set about attempting to integrate a Growth Mindset into my mind. Carol Dweck (pioneer into the Growth Mindset and the mindset phsycological trait as a whole) states that students with a Growth Mindset may display behaviours like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Asking the teacher to demonstrate a new way to solve a problem</li>
                        <li>Volunteering answers in class even when unsure</li>
                        <li>Asking a question even if it might seem basic or ‘stupid’</li>
                        <li>Seeking out problems that will push them instead of problems that keep them safely within their comfort zone.</li>
                    </ul>
                    A significant personal challenge for me is to overcome the 'Fixed Mindset' voice in my head that says not to ask a question for whatever reason.
                    <br>When faced with new problems I will challenge myself to look for new and creative ways to solve or understand the problem at hand, and also to view every environment as a learning environment (by scanning for opportunities to improve skills and enhance knowledge).
                    <br> With my new Growth Mindset I will attempt to view each project as an opportunity for growth and view failure in a different light - as an opportunity to learn from experiences and apply what was learnt next time around.
                
                    Overall I aim to form the confidence to improve by proving my ability to myself in small ways, then allowing that confidence to change the kind of thoughts I have towards challenges.
                    Stopping myself at each challenge and acknowledging that it is a challenge I have yet to defeat, rather than an impassable obstacle that will bring about fear and shame.
                    <br><br>
                    A final, important aspect of the Growth Mindset - particularly for my own personal development, is to be tenacious.
                    By weathering obstacles and getting back up each time you fail you will reinforce the Growth Mindset and aid your progression away from a Fixed Mindset.
