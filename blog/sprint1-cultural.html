    <h2>My Core Personal Values</h2>

<p>My personal values include honesty, friendship, kindness, integrity and independence.
    My favourite week of the year is a festival called KiwiBurn, which is governed by 10 principles (from BurningMan).
    The essence of the festival is that everyone brings what they would like to see at a party whether it be a soundcamp blaring bass music into the night or making cheese toasties by the river for whoever wants them.
    There is no money/transactions for anything, it is a gift-giving economy stressing that each gift should expect nothing in return other than the happiness that it brings to others.
    The fact that everyone is viewed as equal, everything is available to everyone with who wants it and also nothing is forced upon anyone who does not want it brings me a lot of happiness and I feel that it summarises my personal values quite well.
</p>

<h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
    Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
<p>A few weeks back my partner and I went into town to meet a friend for a drink.
    We had met this person a few weeks ago and while they had no ties to our friend group/community we enjoyed their company and they were new to town so we agreed to meet up with them again.
    Skip forwards a few hours and we walked past a nightclub with people spilling out onto the street.
    Our new friend stated that he didn’t want to go to that club because some of the people appeared to him be dressed in drag/transgender and proceeded to speak negatively in very broad terms.
    I was forced to weigh up my personal values: I did not want to be offensive to my new friend however I disagreed and disliked what he was saying about someone who was doing nothing to harm anyone.
    I attempted to discuss his viewpoint in an attempt to understand his thought process and rebutted each of his statements in an attempt to change his viewpoint, however he seemed stubborn and unmoving on the point.
    In the end I decided to leave the night early with my partner and return home and have since not been in contact with the person as I found their point of view hurtful and not something I wanted to associate with.
    <br>The consequences were that I lost a new friend, however after attempting to explain to them why their view was hurtful to others and unnecessary and not getting anywhere I concluded this was not someone I wanted to be friends with or associate with in any way.

<h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
<p>For me the biggest cultural influence on my personal values and identity has been Kiwiburn (A New Zealand Festival).
    Five years ago I was unsure of myself and far more influenced by how I thought other people viewed me, both externally and emotionally.
    After attending my first Kiwiburn I realised that once you stopped placing so much emphasis on other people's perceptions or evaluations of you and instead focused on how you perceived yourself (and then reflected on that), that suddenly there was a whole heap of mental space for me to use to enjoy the things in life that make me happy.
    The Ten Principles of Kiwiburn/Burning Man also helped develop my personal values to what they are today, teaching me how to be understanding and empathetic towards others.

<h3>Areas for development</h3>
<p>I now know that I come from a state of Fixed Mindset.
    Early intelligence and praise for it has led to me avoiding challenges and sometimes settling for mediocrity and not putting in much effort unless I know it is something I am already good at - instead focusing on the possibility of failure and avoiding it.
    I am an introvert who is more turbulent than assertive, which can often lead to me not speaking my thoughts/ideas in group situations.
    Sometimes I find certain social interactions overwhelming and find myself using this as an excuse to not venture out of my comfort zone/challenge myself.
    Occasionally my empathy and compassion towards others can come at my own expense as I will put their priorities and needs above my own.

<h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
    <br>Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
<p>In my old job as cafe manager/barista I would often work on the coffee machine with another person, involving high levels of coordination and discussion.
    When my other highly-skilled second barista was away I had to work with others who were far less competent than myself however we still had to make the same chaotic amount of coffees in the same small period of time.
    The other person became visibly tense as the number of coffees ordered began to pile up and occasionally their slow speed would cause me to become tense and occassionally frustrated.
    I found that whenever I also became tense as well that things quickly fell to pieces so I adopted the strategy of reassurance and trying to appear visibly calm.
    This strategy yielded better results than when I allowed the stress of the situation to get to me as well, but never led to any improvement over time.
    In hindsight I should have provided the lesser skilled staff who were not normally needed to make coffee more training and time on the machine to make coffee when they weren’t in the midst of the morning coffee rush.
    This would have allowed them to build up their own skill set and more importantly confidence in themselves and their ability.
