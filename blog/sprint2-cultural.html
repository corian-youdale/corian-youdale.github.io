        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>

        <h3>What would I like to learn and why?</h3>
            <p>At this point in time I am not sure of my specific career pathway. My long term goal is to secure a job that utilises the skills I learn at EDA and brings me happiness through the work I do and the people I do it with. Due to the broad learning scope of EDA I am not sure which specific career pathway I will go down at this time.
        While I am studying at EDA I would like to develop my communication skills. I think that communication skills are one of the most important human skills (particularly in tech industries) as there are so many different technical languages and levels of understanding, and being able to communicate effectively with people who have far more or less technical skills than myself will be incredibly useful.
        I consider myself a quick learner as I am often able to understand new concepts and information easily. This can sometimes serve as a limitation as if I am not able to grasp a new concept easily I can become frustrated. I think that I was raised with a Fixed Mindset and consider that a limitation that I am working to overcome as I strive to develop a Growth Mindset.
            </p>
        <h3>How will I learn?</h3>
            <p>I have created a Daily Learning plan to give me a structured approach to each day. My current approach to each Sprint is to attempt to finish each Sprint by the Friday of each week, allowing Saturday to review my work as well as review the work of others, communicate, and discuss any relevant topics with other students/facilitators. Sunday will be used as a flexible day, to either further complete the week’s Sprint (such as further Stretch study), get a head start on the following week’s Sprint, or as a rest day with only a light workload.
        Already I have found myself with problems that I was unable to solve. I will always first attempt to solve the problem myself, through further independent research using online resources. If attempts at solutions do not work I will then use the wonderful foundation of students/facilitators that are available to me through the easy communication channels provided on Slack.
        I expect the facilitation team to provide direction and purpose to my learning. I do not expect the facilitation team to provide answers to every query that I may have, instead I expect them to provide me with the materials and knowledge to solve any questions I may have by directing me towards the correct material or asking questions that cause me to rethink my approach to a problem.
        At the moment I have no scheduling conflicts. I am moving house next week but I do not expect that to take much of my time and I have already worked ahead in the course in case I do lose more time than anticipated.
