        <h2>EQ vs. IQ</h2>
        <h4><em>What are they and how do they differ?</em></h4>
        <br>
        <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence/Emotional Quotient (EQ)?</h4>    
        <p>EQ refers to a person’s ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.
            EQ is centered on abilities such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identifying Emotions</li>
                <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
                <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
                <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
                <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <h4>How is it different to IQ (Intelligence Quotient)?</h4>
        <p>A person’s IQ is derived from a standardized intelligence test, with the result being compared to the average scores of other people in the same age group.
            <br>Put simply, IQ is a number that indicates a person’s reasoning or logical ability in comparison to the statistical norm.
            IQ represents abilities such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visual & Spatial processing</li>
                <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
                <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
                <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
                <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An IQ test may be useful for identifying highly capable or gifted individuals, or individuals with mental challenges and special needs.
                <br>However it will not assist in identifying whether a person is a leader or a team-player, whether they work better alone or in groups, or whether they may be dealing with social challenges.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Why is EQ Important?</h4>
            <p>Research has found that individuals with strong leadership potential also tend to be more emotionally intelligent, suggesting that a high EQ is an important quality for business leaders and managers (Srivastava K. Emotional intelligence and organizational effectiveness. Ind Psychiatry J. 2013;22(2):97-9. doi:10.4103/0972-6748.132912)
            <br><br>
            Emotional abilities can also influence the choices that consumers make when confronted with buying decisions.
            Daniel Kahneman found that people would rather deal with a person that they trust and like rather than someone they do not, even if that means paying more for an inferior product (Rupande G. The impact of emotional intelligence on student learning. IJMSR. 2015;3(9):133-136.)
            <br><br>
            This quality of Empathy (the ability to emotionally understand what other people feel, see things from their point of view, and imagine yourself in their place) allows people to build social connections with others and promotes helping behaviours which benefit social relationships.
            <br><br>
            Exhaustion and burnout can take many forms, but signs of emotional and intellectual burnout are often less visible than physical burnout.
            In 2019 the World Health Organization officially characterized burnout as a medical condition.
            Having the Emotional Intelligence to recognise how you experience your workload can make the most significant impact on your well-being.
            <br><br>
            Mindfulness (a type of Attention Training used to develop Emotional Intelligence) supports the progression of self-awareness.
            Strengthening your internal capacity allows you to discern how you are experiencing and relating to your work.
            Knowing this will allow you to better utilize your energy, and acknowledge when you need to rest and recover, preventing burnout.
            <br><br>
            Concentrating on IQ alone and using it as a measurement of success can lead to a Fixed Mindset - The idea that your qualities are carved in stone.
            To someone with a Fixed Mindset, success is about establishing one's superiority.
            This can lead to an urgency to prove yourself over and over again.
            <br><br>
            Utilising Emotional Intelligence can lead to a Growth Mindset - The idea that your basic qualities are things you can improve through your efforts.
            A Growth Mindset will cultivate the idea that personal success is when you work your hardest to become your best.
            Over time this can create a passion for learning, rather than a hunger for approval.
            A Growth Mindset will allow you to not be discouraged by failure, instead to view your apparent ‘failure’ as an instance of learning.
            <br><br>
            This strive for personal development is intertwined with Emotional Intelligence, and recognising that it is the <em>effort</em> that is put in that makes you smart or talented.
            Without the Emotional Intelligence to recognise we are in a Fixed Mindset, we will simply strive to prove our existing abilities and intelligence to reinforce our perceived level of intelligence, rather than adopting a Growth Mindset which will allow us to stretch ourselves through learning by redefining success as <em>becoming</em> smarter.
