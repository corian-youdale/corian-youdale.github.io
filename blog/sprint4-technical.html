                <h4><em>Tell a non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a single problem.</em></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    While writing the homepage that hosts my blogs for this course I came upon a problem with the readability of my webpage.
                    When it was viewed on smaller screens, such as a phone, the span across the top that held my name and a logo photo of a bear would collapse on itself in an awkward way that I did not want.
                    <br><br>My first attempt at problem solving involved googling for an answer.
                    While I found many possible solutions, I was initially overwhelmed by the technical jargon in the possible solutions as it was all quite new to me.
                    I attempted some of the solutions using the advice from google but nothing was working how I wanted it so I asked a peer for help.
                    He pointed me down a similar path by providing me with some keywords to google, which caused me some frustration but did help me by identifying that I wasn’t googling the correct terms.
                    I then received help from a different peer who coached me through the correct code to make the web page display how I wanted on smaller screens.
                    <br><br>I learnt about fine-tuning my google search before attempting some of the solutions presented and I also learnt a bit about myself and how to deal with the frustration that I felt at various points throughout the whole exercise.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4><em>Tell a non-tech friend a story about a time you solved a problem in an elegant way.</em></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I want to start by saying I think we all have different definitions of elegance..
                    <br><br>My flat drinks a lot of coffee, with each flatmate having their own supply of beans and their own brewing techniques.
                    Unfortunately our kitchen does not have a surplus of bench space, and this frustrated me and other flatmates.
                    <br><br>I discussed the problem with my peers (flatmates) and attempted to reach a solution by presenting to them the idea that we all purchase coffee beans as a flat.
                    I used google to locate delicious beans that we could source in bulk from within Wellington, and even found some that would be delivered to our house on a weekly cycle.
                    One of my flatmates was concerned as he does not drink as much coffee as myself or other flatmates, but I was able to present him with a proposal of sorts that showed that even if he drunk half the amount of coffee that he currently drunk it would still be cheaper for him if we all purchased beans together due to the cheaper price we would receive for buying in bulk.
                    <br><br>I felt a great sense of achievement throughout this process as while it was not a complicated solution, I was able to present it in a way that made the benefits easy to understand and compare to our existing setup.
                    I also felt proud of finding a way to not only free up more of our precious bench space, but also to ensure we always had ample delicious coffee, and reduce the amount of plastic packaging we went through each week as a flat.
                    <br><br>I learnt that viewing problems from a group perspective can often lead to simple solutions that might otherwise be overlooked if you simply looked at the problem from a single perspective.

                <h3 class="text-center"><em>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and processes: </em></h3>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Pseudocode:</strong></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I do not feel overly confident with Pseudocoding yet but already my ability and confidence is growing.
                    Every time I write Pseudocode my ability to express my intent in a way that is easy to convert to code is increasing and I am also developing a better understanding of the order in which to interpret what items to code where when I read Pseudocode.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Trying Something:</strong></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I do not feel overly confident in my success rate of trying things when problem solving as I acknowledge I am very new to coding and my knowledge of what to try in different circumstances is limited, but I appreciate that there is almost no harm in trying things due to version control and my ability to undo anything that doesn’t work like I want it to.
                    In turn that makes me confident to always attempt to try things if I think they are worth trying (whether I think they will work, or I think that trying something will further my understanding of it/the problem at hand).
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Rubber Ducky Method:</strong></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    In some sense I am confident in using the Rubber Ducky Method as upon researching it I find it is something I often resort to (although I simply talk out loud to myself, not necessarily to an inanimate object).
                    However, I once again acknowledge my limited knowledge and experience with coding and have found so far that explaining things out loud to myself can sometimes be difficult/fruitless if I have no understanding of the concepts I am attempting to explain.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Reading Error Messages:</strong></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I am quite confident in using error messages for debugging and problem solving.
                    While I wouldn’t go as far as to say I am an expert at error messages (there are still some messages I do not fully understand), I am confident in my ability to use error messages to identify what line of code contains the error, and what common error messages are often referring to.
                    As a lot of my errors/problems are caused by small typos/incorrect syntax I find myself using error messages for problem solving frequently, which has increased my confidence in using them.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Console.logging:</strong></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I am not too confident in using console.log for problem solving/debugging.
                    While I am confident in my knowledge of the function of console.log I acknowledge my inexperience in when and how to use console.log effectively as a problem solving tool.
                    It is definitely something I want to begin to use more for problem solving.
                </p> 
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Googling:</strong></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I am confident in my ability to use Google for problem solving.
                    To summarize something Jo$eph mentioned in one of his videos for this course ‘effective googling is a skill’ and it is a skill I have been developing for years.
                    Sometimes my ability to say what I am trying to do or describe a coding problem I am having can impact the effectiveness of my google searches but I am usually able to finetune my results from reading the return of my initial question and adjusting my search accordingly.
                </p>   
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Asking Your Peers for Help:</strong></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I am confident in my ability to ask peers for help when problem solving.
                    EDA is wonderfully encouraging and expectant of peers to ask for help when they need it and provide it when others are asking, and so far I have received only positive and helpful advice when I have asked for assistance from my peers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Asking Coaches for Help:</strong></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I am confident in my ability to ask coaches for help.
                    Much the same way in asking peers for assistance, EDA has set it up so that I am easily able to contact one of the course facilitators if I require direct assistance from them.
                    I usually save this method of problem solving for only if I have exhausted other forms of problem solving, but I am looking forward to the bootcamp section as learning in person always makes asking questions to coaches easier.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Improving Your Process With Reflection:</strong></h4>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I am not overly confident with my ability to improve my problem solving process through reflection.
                    It is something that I have not done much of so far and it is definitely something I need to improve on.
