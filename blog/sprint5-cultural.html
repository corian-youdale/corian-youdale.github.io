        <h2>Reflection - Foundation Core Skills</h2>
            <h3><em>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</em></h3>
                <p>
                    I have learnt that I come from a very fixed mindset, and that if I wish to overcome this I will need to actively work towards changing it.
                    <br><br>
                    I have learnt that (possibly as a product of my fixed mindset) that I get frustrated easily at things I don’t understand or do not believe that I can easily understand.
                    <br><br>
                    I have learnt that when someone else is speaking I am often busy thinking about what I am going to say next in response to them rather than actively listening to what they are saying, this is also something that I need to be aware of, recognise, and actively work towards changing if I want to see any improvement in this area.
                </p>
                <br>
            <h3><em>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</em></h3>
                <p>
                    Values help us understand our (or someone else's) perspective, which motivates and drives them towards their goals or what causes them to do something in a certain way.
                    <br><br>
                    Empathy is vital for all aspects of learning and programming that involve another human.
                    Empathy allows us to attempt to see a situation from someone else's perspective, allowing us insight into how things may or may not affect them, which will lead to unity and teamwork that is unlikely to be achieved without empathy.
                    <br><br>
                    Self awareness allows us to have a better understanding of ourselves, our needs and our values.
                    Only once we have identified our values, are aware of our true self and have accessed some of the thoughts, feelings and emotions of others through empathy are we able to actively work towards changing ourselves and our work environment to better suit us and our co-workers.

            <h3><em>What has surprised you the most about the Core Learning?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        That we are learning skills that are widely applicable in most if not all industries.
                        I am amazed that there is not more emphasis on these types of learning topics across other industries, such as hospitality.
                        Even as far back as high school, why are some of these things not being taught to people? I feel like students AND teachers could both benefit from learning about Fixed and Growth Mindsets, and I think if we put more emphasis on these types of core values everyone's learning process would be more efficient and enjoyable.
                    </p>
                <br>
            <h3><em>What were the most challenging aspects of the Core Learning?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Self analysis, I seemed to struggle to step back and review myself and my core values.
                        I have also had difficulty with transitioning from my Fixed Mindset to one of Growth, but I understand and acknowledge that this won’t be an instantaneous process and will likely be something that I will have to work on over an extended period of time.
                    </p>
                <br>
            <h3><em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Core Learning in a web development bootcamp course?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Because these are skills which can be applied to any workplace situation and are often not discussed or taught when starting a new job.
                        A person with a strong understanding of the core learning taught in this course will be more likely to get along with their team, communicate effectively and thrive in a new working environment than someone who might have more technical prowess but their social dynamic and interactions with team members leads to them being an inefficient employee.
                    </p>
                <br>
            <h3><em>Does the time you spent studying Core Learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        A small part of me does feel like some of the core learning was time that would have been better spent practicing programming, but I am aware that I have no experience or knowledge of what skills will actually be most useful to me in a programming workplace environment, so I think that opinion is mainly due to the tangible results that learning coding and coding exercises produce. While I cannot necessarily see evidence of my progress with core learning I know that the groundwork that has been laid for me over this course will continue to develop over the rest of my career.
                    </p>

        <h2>Reflection - Preparing for Bootcamp</h2>
            <h3><em>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        At this point in time I am undecided on a particular career pathway.
                        My long term goal is to find work in the tech industry that I find stimulating and enjoyable.
                        Due to the wide array of topics that EDA covers I am not sure what specific aspect of the industry I want to work in yet.
                    </p>
                    <br>
            <h3><em>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        I think my biggest strength will be my ability to work well in a team environment and communicate effectively with others. 
                        I think my biggest limitation may be my Fixed Mindset, and the frustration I sometimes experience when learning new and unfamiliar concepts.
                    </p>
                    <br>
            <h3><em>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        I am concerned that I may begin to run out of motivation and focus towards the end of Bootcamp, or that the stress of the workload and keeping up with the speed and frequency of assessments may begin to affect me negatively.
                    </p>
                    <br>
            <h3><em>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned before I think my Fixed Mindset is something I would definitely like to develop towards a Growth Mindset while I am at EDA. I would also like to work on my self awareness and reflections skills as they are something that I have found challenging throughout the Foundations part of this course.
                    </p>
                    <br>
            <h3><em>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        I expect myself to keep with the learning plan from my earlier blog, and to follow the same rough plan each time I encounter a learning block.
                        I will attempt to solve the problem myself through various methods of problem solving but I will also not hesitate to ask for assistance/advice from peers and the teaching team to ensure that I do not fall behind whilst lamenting over a single holdup.
                        At the same time I will keep assessing my level of skill and progression through the course and discuss with the teaching team if I feel that I am falling behind or struggling at any point in the course.
                    </p>
